Build automation is the act of scripting or automating a wide variety of tasks that software developers do in their day-to-day activities including things like:

    compiling computer source code into binary code
    packaging binary code
    running automated tests
    deploying to production systems
    creating documentation and/or release notes
build management tools have provided even more relief when it comes to automating the build process. Both commercial and open source tools are available to perform more automated build and workflow processing. Some tools focus on automating the pre and post steps around the calling of the build scripts, while others go beyond the pre and post build script processing and also streamline the actual compile and linker calls without much manual scripting. These tools are particularly useful for continuous integration builds where frequent calls to the compile process are required and incremental build processing is needed.

Build script generation tools

    automake
    CMake, a cross-platform tool that generates files for the native build environment, such as makefiles for Unix or Workspace files for Visual Studio
    GNU Build Tools (aka autotools), a collection of tools for portable builds. These in particular include Autoconf and Automake, cross-platform tools that together generate appropriate localized makefiles.
