Java Mobile Media API
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Mobile Media API (MMAPI) is an API specification for the Java ME platform CDC and CLDC devices such as mobile phones. Depending on how it's implemented, the APIs allow applications to play and record sounds and video, and to capture still images. MMAPI was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 135.




The Multimedia Java API is based around four main types of classes in the javax.microedition.media packageâ€”the Manager, the Player, the PlayerListener and various types of Control.

Java ME programmers wishing to use JSR 135 would first make use of the static methods of the Manager class. Although there are other methods such as playTone, the main method used is createPlayer. This takes either a URI or an InputStream, and a MIME type. In most cases, URIs are used. Common URI protocols used include:

The MIME type is optional, and is inferred from the data passed in if not supplied.
