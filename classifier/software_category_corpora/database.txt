Database
A database is an organized collection of data. The data are typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information. For example, modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.
Database management systems (DBMSs) are specially designed software applications that interact with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is a software system designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, SAP HANA, dBASE, MongoDB, FoxPro, IBM DB2, LibreOffice Base, FileMaker Pro, Microsoft Access and InterSystems Cach√©. A database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMSs can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one database. There are different types of database, some of them are as follows: Operational Database, Specific Database, External Database, Hypermedia Database.
Formally, "database" refers to the data themselves and supporting data structures. Databases are created to operate large quantities of information by inputting, storing, retrieving and managing that information. Databases are set up so that one set of software programs provides all users with access to all the data.


A DBMS is responsible for maintaining the integrity and security of stored data, and for recovering information if the system fails.

Both a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular database model.[2] "Database system" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.[3]


    Real-time databases process transactions fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away.

    A spatial database can store the data with multidimensional features. The queries on such data include location based queries, like "Where is the closest hotel in my area?".

    A temporal database has built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model and a temporal version of SQL. More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time.

    A terminology-oriented database builds upon an object-oriented database, often customized for a specific field.

    An unstructured data database is intended to store in a manageable and protected way diverse objects that do not fit naturally and conveniently in common databases. It may include email messages, documents, journals, multimedia objects, etc. The name may be misleading since some objects can be highly structured. However, the entire possible object collection does not fit into a predefined structured framework. Most established DBMSs now support unstructured data in various ways, and new dedicated DBMSs are emerging.
