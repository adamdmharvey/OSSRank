A JavaScript library is a library of pre-written JavaScript which allows for easier development of JavaScript-based applications, especially for AJAX and other web-centric technologies.
While JavaScript, as first developed by Netscape (and later Mozilla), has long had a presence on the Web for many websites, it gained a particular pitch with the rise of the Web 2.0 era of computing, in which JavaScript became increasingly used for the development of user interfaces for applications, both web-based and desktop-based.

JavaScript was also combined with CSS to create dynamic web pages, which have also become popular as a more efficient and accessible alternative to Flash-based websites.
