DevOps (a portmanteau of "development" and "operations") is a concept dealing, among other things with software development, operations and services. It emphasizes communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and information technology (IT) operations personnel.[1][2] DevOps is a response to the interdependence of software development and IT operations. It aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services.[3][4][5][6][7]

Simple processes become clearly articulated using a DevOps approach,[citation needed] which aims to maximize the predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of operational processes. Very often, automation supports this objective.

DevOps integration targets product delivery, quality testing, feature development and maintenance releases in order to improve reliability and security and faster development and deployment cycles. Many of the ideas (and people) involved in DevOps came from the Enterprise Systems Management and Agile software development movements.[8]
