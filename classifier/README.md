## Classificationn module
**OSSRanking** collects *Open Source Projects metadata* to analyse and rank these projects. 
This module classifies each open source project/tool into one or more categories. Classification is important as we intend to analyse, compare and eventually rank projects within categories.

Being able to classify is important as it allows

1. Analysis and tracking trends in similar tools over a timeline

2. Ranking the projects/tools within their own categories

 


### Classification

>####The Story behind ####
This section explains the project *classification* process. To classify *FOSS* 
projects we have defined a taxonomy which is being continously improved. In the Software taxonomy each category is associated with a set of *keywords*. This helps not only during the classification process, but also to search for projects in the visualization process.

The other interesting thing about the classification module is creation of a *Software Corpus* which allows supervised classification using machine learning. Our intention is to continously improve and mature this corpus, so any software can be classified using this corpus.
