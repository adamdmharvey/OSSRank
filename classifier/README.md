## Classificationn module
**OSSRanking** collects *Open Source Projects metadata* to analyse and rank. 
This module classifies each open source project/tool in one or more categories.Classification is important as we intend to analyse,compare and eventually rank projects in same category .

Being able to classify is important as it allows

1.Analyse and track trends in similar tools over a timeline

2.Rank the projects/tools in their own categories

 


### Classification

>####The Story behind ####
This section explains  project *classification* process.To classify *FOSS* 
projects we have defined taxonomy , which is contineously improved.In our Software taxonomy each category is associated with a set of *keywords*.This helps us not only during classification process,also to search for projects in visualization process.
The other interesting in classification module is creation of a *Software Corpus* which allows supervised classification using machine learning.Our intention is to contineously improve and mature this corpus , so any software can be classified using this corpus.
