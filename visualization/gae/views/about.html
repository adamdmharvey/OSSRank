                    <p>There are millions of open-source software projects and libraries available on the internet and many more get added every day.</p>

                    <p>As a prospective user of open source software, you probably find yourself going through a process
            something like this:
                                    <ol>
                <li>Search for candidate projects you could use to solve a particular problem</li>
                <li>Evaluate various projects that meet your search criteria</li>
                <li>Visit each of their project sites and source code repositories to try to determine things like maturity of the project, size and activity level of the community, responsiveness to issues</li>
                <li>Look around on StackOverflow, Twitter and various discussion forums to see what people are saying about it</li>
            </ol>

             OSSRank attempts to automate this whole process by:
            <ol>
                <li>Discovering open-source projects by collecting their metadata from GitHub
                <li>Classifying them into a growing list of specified categories
                <li>Collecting data about them from stackexchange & finding their social footprint on twitter
                <li>Continuously evaluating them and tracking their growth over a timeline
                <li>Ultimately ranking each project within its categories
            </ol> 
                 
            In the future we plan to addin sentiment analysis of tweets and add security analysis as part of our evaluation.
