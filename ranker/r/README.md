OSSRank.R reads the project data from MongoDB and creates scores and ranks based on metrics like GitHub forks and Twitter mentions, which are normalized on a 0-1 scale. The metrics are normalized so that we can give equal weight to metrics with different magnitudes. For example, we would expect that a project would have a large difference in the amount of GitHub forks compared to the amount of Twitter mentions. Normalizing allows us to rectify this difference. 

Scores are created for each project by summing the normalized metrics. We then rank projects within their respective categories based on these scores and write back to MongoDB.
